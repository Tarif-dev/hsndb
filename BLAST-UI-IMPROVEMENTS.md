# BLAST UI Improvements - Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Fixed

### âœ… 1. Removed Organism Column

**Problem**: The organism column was showing in BLAST results table but wasn't needed for the HSNDB database.

**Solution**:

- Removed organism column from results table header and body
- Removed organism field from BlastHit interface
- Removed organism from CSV/TSV export formats
- Removed organism from filtering logic
- Removed organism from backend BlastHit return object
- Cleaned up organism analysis in useBlastSearch hook

### âœ… 2. Fixed User Experience Issue

**Problem**: When users clicked "View Protein" button, they navigated to protein details page but lost their BLAST search results when going back.

**Solution**:

- Changed protein detail links to open in new tab using `window.open()`
- Users can now view protein details while keeping BLAST results page open
- Improved workflow for comparing multiple proteins from search results

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

### Frontend Files Modified:

- `src/components/BlastResults.tsx`
  - Removed organism column from table
  - Changed handleProteinClick to open new tab
  - Removed organism from filtering and export functions
- `src/utils/blastApi.ts`
  - Removed organism field from BlastHit interface
- `src/hooks/useBlastSearch.ts`
  - Removed organism-based analysis

### Backend Files Modified:

- `hsndb-blast-backend/utils/blastRunner.js`
  - Removed organism field from parseBlastHit return object

## ðŸ“Š Updated Table Structure

**Before:**
| HSN ID | Gene | Protein Name | Organism | E-value | Score | Identity | Actions |

**After:**
| HSN ID | Gene | Protein Name | E-value | Score | Identity | Actions |

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Improvements

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Removed unnecessary organism column saves space
2. **Better Workflow**: Protein details open in new tab preserving search context
3. **Consistent Exports**: CSV/TSV exports now match table structure
4. **Simplified Filtering**: No longer filters by organism (not needed for single-organism database)

## âœ… Validation

- [x] Removed all organism references from frontend
- [x] Updated TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Fixed backend response structure
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility
- [x] No compilation errors
- [x] Export functions updated
- [x] New tab functionality implemented

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing

The changes are now complete and ready for testing:

1. Start the backend server
2. Open the frontend application
3. Run a BLAST search
4. Verify organism column is gone
5. Test that protein links open in new tabs
6. Verify exports work correctly

All changes maintain the existing functionality while improving the user experience!
