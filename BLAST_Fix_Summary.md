# BLAST Implementation Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Static Mock Results Problem**

- **Issue**: The original `generateMockResults` function returned the same hardcoded proteins for all queries
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote the function to generate sequence-dependent results based on:
  - Sequence length (short, medium, long)
  - Sequence content hash for deterministic variation
  - Different protein pools with varying similarity levels

### 2. **Incorrect HSN ID Format**

- **Issue**: Mock HSN IDs used fake format (HSN001234, HSN002156, etc.)
- **Fix**: Updated to use realistic HSN IDs matching database format (HSN_P04406, HSN_P60709, etc.)

### 3. **Navigation Problem**

- **Issue**: BLAST results were navigating to `/protein/${hsnId}` but ProteinDetails expects database `id`
- **Fix**:
  - Added `id` field to `BlastHit` interface (database primary key)
  - Updated protein pools to include database IDs (protein_001, protein_002, etc.)
  - Modified `BlastResults` component to use database ID for navigation
  - Fixed `handleProteinClick` function calls

## Updated BLAST API Features

### Dynamic Result Generation

- **Sequence Length Based**: Different protein pools based on query length
  - Short (< 200 aa): Variable results from medium/lower similarity pools
  - Medium (200-500 aa): Mixed results from all pools
  - Long (> 500 aa): High similarity matches
- **Sequence-Specific Scores**: E-values, scores, and identity percentages vary based on:
  - Query sequence characteristics
  - Position in results list
  - Realistic statistical distribution

### Proper HSN ID Format

- All HSN IDs now follow the format `HSN_P######` (e.g., HSN_P04406)
- Match the actual database schema and format
- Consistent with existing protein data structure

### Correct Navigation

- BLAST results now include both HSN ID (for display) and database ID (for navigation)
- Navigation uses `/protein/${databaseId}` which matches ProteinDetails page expectations
- Ensures seamless user experience from BLAST results to protein details

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Different sequences produce different results**
✅ **HSN IDs use correct format (HSN_P######)**
✅ **Database IDs included for proper navigation**
✅ **Realistic score distributions and statistics**
✅ **Proper protein pools based on sequence characteristics**
✅ **Navigation to protein details works correctly**

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/blastApi.ts`**

   - Updated `BlastHit` interface to include database `id`
   - Completely rewrote `generateMockResults` function
   - Added helper functions for sequence similarity and alignment generation
   - Updated protein pools with realistic HSN IDs and database IDs

2. **`src/components/BlastResults.tsx`**
   - Updated `handleProteinClick` to use database ID for navigation
   - Fixed onClick handlers to use `hit.id` instead of `hit.hsnId`

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Real Database Integration**: Replace mock protein pools with actual database queries
2. **Actual BLAST Server**: Connect to real BLAST server instead of mock implementation
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement proper caching and pagination for large result sets
4. **Enhanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering and sorting options

The BLAST implementation now provides realistic, sequence-dependent results with proper HSN ID formatting and correct navigation flow.
